# Sparkles (v1.0)
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/cc-nc-sa.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)
## What is it?

Sparkles is what I describe as a collection of tools to enhance the creation of pyrotechnical shows in the game.

> Over the last years, I've created plenty of events involving such shows. I started from "using simple firework /summon commands" to "creating a datapack spawning various amount of effects" (which are coordinated and synchronized to a piece of music).
